# MagicChatbox
### Introducing VRC Magic ChatBox version 0.4.0 - the ultimate companion for all your VRChat needs! Whether you're on desktop or in VR, we've got you covered with our compact and modern UI.

We have made some exciting changes and added new features to enhance your experience. We have also updated our codebase to support UTF-8 and made the switch from Sharp OSC to CoreOSC-VRC-UTF8, which was a collaborative effort with VRCWizard.

### Option Tab:

- Show Time in VR: This new option allows you to only display the current time in VR, without the 'my time:' prefix.
- Time Format: You can now choose to display the time in 24-hour format, making it easier to read.
- Listening Prefix: We have changed the 'listening to' prefix to ðŸŽµ, giving your messages a more playful look.
- IP and Port: You can now change the OSC IP and port from the Option tab, allowing for more customization.

### Integrations Tab:

- Personal Message: We have added a new integration for Personal Messages, allowing you to easily share a message with others.

### Status Tab:

- Sorting: You can now sort your status items based on creation date, recent usage, and if they are a favorite.
- Interactions: Each status item now has three types of interactions, activate, delete, and favorite.
- Saving: We have implemented a local json file to save your status items, ensuring they are always available to you.
- Input Box: A new input box has been added, allowing you to quickly add new status items.

### Other Changes:

- Overloading Characters: In the event that the number of characters in your message exceeds 140, the VRCMagicChatBox will automatically disable some integrations. The order of disabled integrations will be as follows: Personal Message, Windows Activity, Current Time, and finally Spotify.
- Spotify Integration: We have improved the Spotify integration and it will now display the song and artist in the format of {song} áµ‡Ê¸ {artist}. In the case the title cannot be created, it will fall back to the old code.
- Version Checker: We have added a built-in version checker to Github, which will inform you if you have the latest version, if a new version is available, or if you are running a preview version.
