# MagicChatbox
Hi everyone, I've created this simple application to show some cool stuff in the new "VRChat text chatbox" that's currently live.

# Currently working on version 4.0 (22 jan 2023) see beta build code :)
[Go to releases](https://github.com/BoiHanny/vrcosc-magicchatbox/releases)

## For now, I've implemented the following in a compact modern UI:

### __DESKTOP MODE:__
- It will show "*On desktop*";
- show in which application you are focused, for example, if you message someone on Discord it will show "*On desktop in Discord*";
- Spotify activity > shows what song is playing or if your Spotify is paused.

### __VR MODE:__
- It will show "In VR";
- you have the option to show your local time in-game;
- Spotify activity > shows what song is playing or if your Spotify is paused.

## To-do list
- Check if Spotify free version is working correctly;
- ~~rewrite `BuildOSC`;~~
- ~~save settings to a local JSON file on close;~~
- look into CPU, RAM and GPU stats;
- create a valuable and friendly chatting tab with an always-on-top option, ESC = clear, hotkey to switch quickly to VRChat and more;
- privacy filter on applications when using the focused application option (desktop), should show up as "*On desktop in a private app*";
- add options in settings like the OSC IP and port options for the sender/receiver, auto start? update check? reset to default and more;
- look into displaying your heart rate by using a pulsoid device or other supported devices.
