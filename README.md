### Features

- **VR mode:** MagicChatbox shows "In VR" on the UI, and you have the option to display your local time in-game. MagicChatbox also provides a Spotify integration that shows the currently playing song, adding to the immersive experience. You can enable or disable this feature from the options menu.

- **Desktop mode:** MagicChatbox shows "On desktop" on the UI, and displays which application you are currently focused on. It's a great way to keep track of your messages while multitasking. The Spotify integration also shows the currently playing song, making it easier to keep up with your favorite tunes.

- **Status tab:** One of the most exciting changes we made in version 0.4.0 is the addition of the Status tab, which provides an easy way to manage your status items. You can sort your status items based on creation date, recent usage, and if they are a favorite. Each status item has three types of interactions - activate, delete, and favorite - and you can quickly add new items using the input box.

- **Personal Message integration:** In addition to the Status tab, we have also added a new Personal Message integration, allowing you to easily share messages with others.

- **Time options:** MagicChatbox offers an option to show only the current time in VR, without the "my time:" prefix. You can choose to display the time in a 24-hour format, making it easier to read.

- **OSC customization:** We have updated our codebase to support UTF-8 and made the switch from Sharp OSC to CoreOSC-VRC-UTF8, which was a collaborative effort with VRCWizard. MagicChatbox also provides an option to change the OSC IP and port from the options menu, allowing for more customization.

- **Local save and version checker:** We have implemented a local JSON file to save your status items, ensuring they are always available to you. The application also features a built-in version checker that informs you if you have the latest version, if a new version is available, or if you are running a preview version.

- **Overload feature:** Finally, MagicChatbox features a unique overload feature that disables some integrations automatically if the number of characters in your message exceeds 140. The order of disabled integrations will be as follows: Personal Message, Windows Activity, Current Time, and finally Spotify. MagicChatbox will try to fill the 144 character cap, but when above it, it will disable the integration.
